# 2015 World Population Analysis

This project analyzes global population data from the year 2015 using SQL and Python visualizations.

## Overview

- Explored demographic insights from a database containing country-specific information.
- Identified outliers and performed statistical analyses to understand population trends.
- Visualized data using histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, and box plots to illustrate key findings.

## Key Visualizations

- Histogram: Shows the distribution of population across countries.
- Scatter Plot: Illustrates the relationship between population and population growth.
- Bar Charts: Highlight the top and least populous countries.
- Box Plots: Display population growth rates across countries.
- Pie Charts: Analyze the impact of migration, birth, and death rates on population growth for specific countries.

## Technologies Used

- SQL for data querying and analysis.
- Python with matplotlib for data visualization.
